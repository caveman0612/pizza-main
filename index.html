        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been good with computers, but in college I
          discovered programming. After a few weeks I feel in love with it. I
          had been doing it as a hobby since, but about a year ago I realized that I
          wanted to do this as a career.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my time in the military and being a math tutor. I am very
          disiplined which has allowed me to teach myself a far amount of
          programming fundamentals, but I am hoping thinkful can fill the gaps
          in my knowledage and help me land my first job in the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>When I am not programming I like to make stuff with wood. I have been doing carpentry
          and woodcarving since I was a little boy living in rural Minnesota.
