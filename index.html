          I am a software developer. I currently live in Tacoma WA. I love
          everything about programming, and look forward to doing for the rest
          of my life.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been good with computers, but in college I discovered
          programming. After a few weeks I feel in love with it. I had been
          doing it as a hobby since, but about a year ago I realized that I
          wanted to do this as a career.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my time in the military and being a math tutor. I am very
          disciplined which has allowed me to teach myself a far amount of
          programming fundamentals, but I am hoping Thinkful can fill the gaps
          in my knowledge and help me land my first job in the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years I have had to work with many people from all over the
          world. As a soldier I learned how to be flexible to what ever team
          dynamics are presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not programming I like to make stuff with wood. I have been
          doing carpentry and woodcarving since I was a little boy living in
          rural Minnesota.
